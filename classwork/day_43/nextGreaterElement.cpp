/*

1)	 Given an array, print the Next Greater Element (NGE) for every element.
The Next greater Element for an element x is the first greater element on the right side 
of x in array. Elements for which no greater element exist, 
consider next greater element as -1.

For the input array [4, 5, 2, 25, 7,8}, the next greater elements for each
element are as follows.

Element --> NGE
output:

4 --> 5

5 --> 25

2 --> 25

25 --> -1
7 --> 8
8 --> -1
