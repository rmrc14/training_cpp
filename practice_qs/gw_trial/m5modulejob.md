Great — let's break down M5: REPL / Input UI, which corresponds to the ProgramInterface/ folder and especially CommandLineEditor.

🧩 M5 – REPL / Input UI
✅ Primary Role:
M5 is responsible for interacting with the user — accepting typed input, supporting line editing (like backspace, arrow keys), and handling REPL logic (READY., OK, etc.).

📌 Files Involved:
cpp
Copy
Edit
gw_basic/ProgramInterface/
├── CommandLineEditor.h / .cpp   ← Core REPL input loop
└── SpecialKeyHandler.h          ← (Optional) arrow key, F-keys, etc.
🧠 What M5 Does:
Task	Description
Read input	Captures user input line by line (e.g. 10 PRINT "HELLO").
Handle editing	Manages backspaces, line editing (optionally arrow keys).
Switch modes	Supports REPL (interactive input) vs file mode (auto-run .bas).
Interface with Interpreter	Passes each line to GWBasic64::runLine(...) or equivalent.
Prompt	Displays the familiar READY. or > prompt.

🧪 Example Interaction:

Edit
READY.
10 PRINT "HELLO"
20 END
LIST
RUN
All of this is captured by CommandLineEditor, passed to the interpreter via M6 (GWBasic64), and stored via M4 (ProgramMemory).

👀 Internals of CommandLineEditor
In Windows (testing mode):

cpp
Copy
Edit
std::string CommandLineEditor::getLine() {
    std::string line;
    std::getline(std::cin, line);  // Standard C++ input
    return line;
}
In your custom OS:
You’d replace this with:

cpp
Copy
Edit
std::string CommandLineEditor::getLine() {
    std::string line;
    char c;
    while ((c = SystemInterface::getChar()) != '\n') {
        if (c == '\b') { /* handle backspace */ }
        line += c;
    }
    return line;
}

🧠 Summary
Submodule	Purpose
CommandLineEditor	Captures input, supports line editing, returns full command line
SpecialKeyHandler (optional)	Handles arrow keys, command history, etc.
Connection to rest	Input from M5 → Parsed by M2 → Executed by M3 → Stored via M4

✅ Final Verdict
M5 is the user interface for the interpreter — think of it like the shell or terminal of GW-BASIC.

It simulates what you saw in classic BASIC:

shell
Copy
Edit
READY.
> 10 PRINT "HELLO"
> RUN
HELLO
Without M5, you'd have no interactive mode.

Would you like me to give you a dual-mode CommandLineEditor implementation — one for Windows testing (using std::getline) and one for your custom OS (using SystemInterface::getChar())?
