### To make your GW-BASIC 64 interpreter work end-to-end, here’s a checklist of all components (with purpose) needed for a functional basic interpreter — both interactive (REPL) and file-based execution.

## ✅ 1. Main GWBasic64 Class
This orchestrates everything:

Loads .BAS file (loadAndRunFile)

Starts REPL (runREPL)

Calls executeProgram() or executeLine(...)

✔️ You already have this.

## ✅ 2. Lexer (Tokenizer)
Parses BASIC source code line into tokens like PRINT, variables, numbers, strings.

Purpose:
Convert:


10 PRINT "HELLO"
into:


{Token::NUMBER, Token::PRINT, Token::STRING_LITERAL}
✔️ You have a lexer.tokenize() call in your code — make sure your Lexer class exists and supports:

Keywords (PRINT, IF, THEN, GOTO, etc.)

Identifiers (variable names)

Literals (numbers, strings)

Symbols (=, +, -, etc.)

## ✅ 3. Parser
Turns tokens into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for execution.

✔️ You have parser.parse(tokens) — make sure:

Each BASIC statement is handled: PRINT, LET, IF, GOTO, etc.

Errors like syntax errors are caught and thrown

## ✅ 4. Executor (Interpreter)
Executes parsed ASTs:

Prints output

Assigns variable values

Manages control flow (GOTO, IF, FOR, etc.)

✔️ You call executer.execute(ast) — so implement:

Variable memory (SymbolTable)

Support for control flow

Arithmetic expression evaluation

## ✅ 5. ProgramMemory
Stores the user's BASIC program by line number.


std::map<int, std::string>
✔️ You already have:

storeLine(int, string)

getAllLines()

clear()
Add:

removeLine(int) (when storing a line with just line number like 10)

Sorting by line number (already handled by map)

## ✅ 6. SystemInterface
Handles platform-specific I/O:

readLine(), putChar(), getChar(), printString()

File I/O (openFile, closeFile)

✔️ Your SystemInterface already helps run on Windows and MiniOS.
Make sure:

readLine() preserves empty lines

Handles file open/close errors

Input abstraction works both in REPL and file mode

## ✅ 7. CommandLineEditor (CLI)
Handles user input line-by-line for REPL.

✔️ You call cli.getLine(line) — implement:

Input handling (supports backspace, enter)

Uses SystemInterface::getChar() and builds the string

## ✅ 8. ConsoleIO
Handles how output is printed (used in LIST, error messages, etc.)

✔️ Used in programMemory.list(console) (though not implemented yet)

## ✅ 9. ErrorHandler
Handles errors nicely:

cpp
Copy
Edit
runtimeError(lineNo, "Message")
✔️ You already have it — useful in REPL and file mode.

## ✅ 10. Built-in Statements & Functions
You must implement:

PRINT, LET, GOTO, IF, FOR/NEXT, GOSUB/RETURN, INPUT

NEW, RUN, LIST, CLEAR

Functions like ABS, SIN, INT, RND

## ✅ 11. Basic Data Types
Support:

Strings

Integers

Float (optional)

Boolean (internal)

✔️ Lexer, Parser, and Executor must cooperate on type handling.

## ✅ 12. REPL & Command Parser
Handles direct input like:

10 PRINT "HI" → store in ProgramMemory

LIST, RUN, EXIT, NEW, etc.

✔️ You have this partially in runREPL().

## ✅ 13. File Format (.bas) Loader
Already done:

cpp
Copy
Edit
loadAndRunFile("file.bas");
Just ensure:

Input lines preserve blank lines

UTF-8 or ASCII-safe read

## ✅ 14. Output Testing Mode
Optional but useful:

Log output to a file (test automation)

Unit testing support (esp. Lexer/Parser/Executor)

## ✅ 15. Cross-Compilation Support
Already doing:

SystemInterface_Windows.cpp vs SystemInterface_MiniOS.cpp

Use -DTARGET_MINIOS for MiniOS-specific build

🚀 Final Integration Tasks
Feature	Status	To-Do
File execution	✅ Done	Validate multi-line flow
REPL	✅ Partially	Implement more commands like LIST, NEW, SAVE
ProgramMemory::storeLine(string)	❗ Needed	Extract line number, store or delete line
Variable Evaluation	🟡 In progress	Add SymbolTable support for LET, PRINT x
Expression Parser	❗ Needed	Evaluate math logic (optional AST for arithmetic)
Test framework	❌ Not Yet	Add basic test cases for Lexer, Parser, Executor

📦 Minimal Demo to Confirm Working
Try this file:

<pre>
10 LET A = 5
20 PRINT "A is: ";
30 PRINT A
40 END</pre>
Build & run:
gw_basic_64.exe demo.bas
Expected output:
A is: 5
