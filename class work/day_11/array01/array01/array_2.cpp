Input Format:
The first line contains an integer, denoting the size of the array.
The second line contains integers denoting the elements
of the array.
Constraints
1<= n<=100
1<=arr<= 1000, where arr is the ith element of the array.

Output Format:
The output line contains integer denoting an equilibrium
index (if any) or -1 (if no equilibrium indexes exist).
